## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
x = c(rnorm(1:100), NA)

x %>% sum(x,na.rm = TRUE)


#library(dplyr)

set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

# Generate 1000 random samples, filter out negatives, and compute mean
mean_positive <- rnorm(1000) %>%
  replace(. < 0, NA) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)

# Print result
print(mean_positive)
```
```{r}
#library(dplyr)

# Sample data frame with true values (t) and predicted values (y)
data <- data.frame(
  t = c(3, 5, 2, 8, 7),
  y = c(2.5, 5.3, 1.8, 7.5, 6.9)
)

# Compute RMSE using a pipeline
rmse <- data %>%
  mutate(sq_diff = (t - y)^2) %>%  # Compute squared differences
  summarise(mean_sq_diff = mean(sq_diff)) %>%  # Compute mean squared difference
  pull(mean_sq_diff) %>%  # Extract value
  sqrt()  # Compute square root

# Print the RMSE
print(rmse)
```
```{r}
data = data.frame (s = c(3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1), 
                   t = c(4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11))

# Compute the RMSE using a pipeline 
rmse = data %>%
  mutate(sq_diff = (s - t)**2) %>%
  summarise(mean_sq_diff = mean(sq_diff)) %>%
  pull(mean_sq_diff) %>% sqrt()

# Print the RMSE
print(rmse)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, col = "red")

plot(cars)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Basic
ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, the idea that you can build every graph from the same components: a data set, a coordinate system,
and geoms—visual marks that represent data points.
To display values, map variables in the data to visual properties of the geom (aesthetics) like size, color, and x and y locations.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = "red"))

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist, colour = "blue"))

last_plot() #Returns the last plot.

ggsave("plot.png", width = 5, height = 5) # Saves last plot as 5’ x 5’ file named "plot.png" in working directory. Matches file type to file extension.
```
```{r}
iris %>% ggplot() + geom_point(aes (x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), col = "red")
```

### Aes
- color and fill - string ("red", "#RRGGBB")
- linetype - integer or string (0 = "blank", 1 = "solid", 2 = "dashed", 3 = "dotted", 4 = "dotdash", 5 = "longdash", 6 = "twodash")
- size - integer (in mm for size of points and text) linewidth - integer (in mm for widths of lines)
- shape - integer/shape name or a single character ("a")
- Common aesthetic values. nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))

### Geoms 
- Use a geom function to represent data points, use the geom’s aesthetic properties to represent variables. Each function returns a layer.

#### GRAPHICAL PRIMITIVES
```{r}
a <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy, lintype = 1))
a

b <- ggplot(seals, aes(x = long, y = lat))
b

#a + geom_blank()

```
```{r}
economics %>% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = date, y = unemploy), col = "blue")
```
```{r}
seals %>% ggplot() + geom_point((aes(x = lat, y = long)), col = "pink") 

```

```{r}
#a + expand_limits()

b + geom_curve(aes(yend = lat + 1, xend = long + 1), curvature = 1)

a + geom_path(lineend = "butt", linejoin = "round", linemitre = 1)

a + geom_polygon(aes(alpha = 10, col = "blue"))

b + geom_rect(aes(xmin = long, ymin = lat,xmax = long + 1, ymax = lat + 1))

a + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = unemploy - 900, ymax = unemploy + 900, color = "red"))
```
